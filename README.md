## Getting started



## Templates

So that *shortly* has something to use for templates, HTML, CSS etc, you need to tell *shortly* where the templates are stored. We do this first as we need to tell *shortly* where they are in the next stage (configuration).

The easiest way to do this to get started is to create a folder somewhere, say /opt/shortly like follows.

    mkdir -p /opt/shortly
    cd /opt/shortly
    git clone git@github.com:rossjones/shortly-templates.git
    
You should make a note of the path to the templates, you'll need it in the configuration step later.  In this case it is /opt/shortly/shortly-templates    
    

## Configuration

Run

    shortly make-config <filename>

<filename> should be the name of a file to contain the configuration. If the filename provided is a full path, you need to make sure the folders in the path already exists (for now).


|Section|Key|Value|
|----|----|----|
|server|hostname|The hostname for the server serving the data|
||bind|The address to bind to, could be 0.0.0.0|
||port|The port to serve the data on|
|database|url|The url specifying the database connection|
|templates|path|The path to the location where the templates can be found|

The defaults in the config file generated by 'make-config' will not work, you **must** change the values in the file.
