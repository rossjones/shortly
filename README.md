## Getting started



## Templates

The templates in *shortly* are not built-in. To have the system work you need to obtain some HTML, CSS etc, and install them on your system.
We do this first as we will need the location of the templates for the configuration.

The easiest way to do this to get started is to create a folder somewhere, say /opt/shortly like follows.

    mkdir -p /opt/shortly
    cd /opt/shortly
    git clone git@github.com:rossjones/shortly-templates.git
    
You should make a note of the path to the templates, you'll need it in the configuration step later.  In this case it is `/opt/shortly/shortly-templates`   
    
If you don't like the default templates, and want to provide your own, you can just fork the [shortly-templates](git@github.com:rossjones/shortly-templates.git) project and make your own modifications to the CSS, HTML or JS.

## Configuration

Run

    shortly make-config <filename>

<filename> should be the name of a file to contain the configuration. If the filename provided is a full path, you need to make sure the folders in the path already exists (for now).


|Section|Key|Value|
|----|----|----|
|server|hostname|The hostname for the server serving the data|
||bind|The address to bind to, could be 0.0.0.0|
||port|The port to serve the data on|
|database|url|The url specifying the database connection|
|templates|path|The path to the location where the templates can be found|

The defaults in the config file generated by 'make-config' will not work, you **must** change the values in the file.
